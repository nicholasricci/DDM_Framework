HOW TO USE THIS FRAMEWORK?

1 - First of all you need to put your algorithms in Algorithms folder;
2 - Come back and you can launch the "./launcher.sh --help" command to see what launcher can do.
3 - Launch "./launcher.sh configure" to configure the framework with some variable like: START_EXTENTS, MAX_EXTENTS,
STEP_SIZE, CORES, ALFAS, ALFAS_PAR, DIMENSION.
4 - You could use the library in c inside this framework to your algorithm. Copy into your algorithm and arrange them for the
structure of your project.
if you don't want use that library you MUST consider that input in argv variable is in this order: 
argv[1] = EXTENTS
argv[2] = DIMENSION
argv[3] = ALFA
the output must be one file with the name with the name of executable, you can retrieve the name of executable with:
argv[0]
the name file must be like this executable.txt
5 - After configure phase you can use the "./launcher.sh run" command to build and run all the algorithms with the configuration
that you set earlier.
6 - At the end you can find your result in the root dirctory in "_results" and "_graphs" folder.
