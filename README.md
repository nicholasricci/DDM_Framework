This archive contains framework with various kind of test useful to
perform your algorithms in a coherent way. You can also find some 
algorithms implemented by me and my colleagues.

Contains also all the source code, the shell scripts, the raw
data obtained in the experiments execution and the graph sources used 
in the paper: 

  M. Marzolla, G. D'Angelo, M. Mandrioli, A Parallel Data Distribution
  Management Algorithm, to appear in proc. IEEE/ACM International
  Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications
  (DS-RT 2013), oct 30â€”nov 1, 2013, Delft, the Netherlands

More information about how use this framework you can find inside
"documentation.pdf" file, inside of it you can read how to install 
your algorithms and how fix their to be coherent with the entire 
framework.

Implemented algorithms inside:

1) sort_matching_standard/

Contains a slightly modified version of the Sort Matching DDM algorithm.
The original version of this implementation can be found at:
https://github.com/zAvo/sort-matching

The Sort Matching DDM source code is distributed under the GNU Affero 
General Public License.

2) interval_tree/

Contains a preliminary implementation of the Interval Tree Matching (ITM) 
DDM algorithm that is described in the paper.
